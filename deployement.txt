We  have new verison for deployement - So we have new Image i.e. tag change of image. 
So we have to rollout deployement for our new verion. 
lets say no of replicas are 6 

kubectl rollout status deployement firstdeploy
# when we trigger a deployement then to check the status of rollout use above command. 

Alos check when run new deployement
kubectl apply -f firstdeployement ; watch "kubectl get rs -o wide "
We will see 1 replica creating and one deleting. That is rolling update. 

kubectl rollout status deployement firstdeploy
This will give logs command for rolling update. 

  
Rollout will only trigger when we chnage in pod sepcification. 
If we update replicas from 5 to 10 then rollout will not trigger. As it is not part of pod specification file. 
     eg from template. 
Template    
spec:
      containers:
      - name: webapp
        image: richardchesterwood/k8s-fleetman-webapp-angular:release0-5




LEt say 
replicas:10
minReadySecond: 30        How much time after pod has been created we show it in a ready state. I.e after 30 seconds when pod create it come into ready state. 
stratefy:
    RollinUpdate:
       maxSurge:2                    #  max surge meaning 2 so total will be 12 i.e create 2 extra for deployement because maxunavailable:0 so all 10 should be present. 
       maxunavailable:2              #  maxunavailable 2 means at a time 2 old will dlete and 2 new will come up, then again next 2 will dlete and next 2 will come up. (We can also give in percentange)
    typr: RollinUpdate # by defualt deployement is rolling update only.
