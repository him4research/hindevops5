# Kubernetis manage its own private service discovery or Called DNS . 
# this services are in Key:value paris
Key are lables to identify kubenrnetis services 
And Values are Ip addresses of those service. 
Service name is kube-dns 
So 2 pods in same cluster will talk to each other using this DNS service/ 
So this service is in kube-system namespace 
kubectl get all -n kube-system

kubectl get ns 

Inside the pod run - 
cat /etc/resolv.conf    this will give configure DNS name resolution going to work.  Nameserver 
Try to run nslookup for our database - nslookup database  (our mysql server service name is databse.)
So service descovery means name of service act as a dns or FQDN for that service or pod.
