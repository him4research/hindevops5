We  have new verison for deployement - So we have new Image i.e. tag change of image. 
So we have to rollout deployement for our new verion. 
lets say no of replicas are 6 

kubectl rollout status deployement firstdeploy
# when we trigger a deployement then to check the status of rollout use above command. 

Alos check when run new deployement
kubectl apply -f firstdeployement ; watch "kubectl get rs -o wide "
We will see 1 replica creating and one deleting. That is rolling update. 

kubectl rollout status deployement firstdeploy
This will give logs command for rolling update. 

  
Rollout will only trigger when we chnage in pod sepcification. 
If we update replicas from 5 to 10 then rollout will not trigger. As it is not part of pod specification file. 
     eg from template. 
Template    
spec:
      containers:
      - name: webapp
