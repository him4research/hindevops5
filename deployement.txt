We  have new verison for deployement - So we have new Image i.e. tag change of image. 
So we have to rollout deployement for our new verion. 
lets say no of replicas are 6 

kubectl rollout status deployement firstdeploy
# when we run 

  
Rollout will only trigger when we chnage in pod sepcification. 
If we update replicas from 5 to 10 then rollout will not trigger. As it is not part of pod specification file. 
     eg 
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: webapp
        image: richardchesterwood/k8s-fleetman-webapp-angular:release0-5
