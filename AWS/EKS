One EC2 instance is one node in. i.e. physical server in genral term.
Multiple nodes or Ec2 are called cluster. 
Matser Node will schduling the jobs to other nodes. 
API gatway will be running atleast 2 nodes. 
using EBS for elastic block storages. 
So we have 3 nodes and 1 master node. 
Kops Vs EKS (KOPS are older and good track record) We have take care of master nodes. 
kops - we have to responsible for master node. By deafult we get single master. 
eksctl Fargate no need to manage atall
I am choosing KOPS
